# Public Interface to develop a Solve-Technique

public interface-project for further third-party development.

## In order to keep the core implementation closed, this project contains all necessary information for developing a solve technique

Originally this project was used to develop own solving techniques for solving sudokus.
In order to make the interfaces necessary for the development publicly accessible, all necessary interfaces were outsourced to this project.
